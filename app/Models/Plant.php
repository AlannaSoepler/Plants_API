     * All eloquent models are protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities 
     * The the model class, here, i can make models attributes accessible and editable for users by using the fillable array . 
     * if there are attributes i want to prevent users to change and access i will use the guarded array. 
     * On the other hand i can create an empty graded array. This means the same as if i had added all the attributes in the fillable array.
